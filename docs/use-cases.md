# Postcards

When I'm archiving images of a postcard
  I want to store the front, back, and context/metadata (physical size, how it flips) together
    So that I don't accidentally lose/separate the different parts.

  I want to be able to mark areas as private and tastefully hide the information within them
    So that I can hide my address when sharing or displaying.

  I want to be able to use a command line tool
    So I can archive many postcards quickly and in an automated way.

  I want to be able to use a web-based tool to archive a postcard
    So that I can do it without needing anything installed.

  I want to be able to store text transcriptions of the writing on the postcard
    So I can search through a large postcard collection easily.

When I am displaying an archived postcard
  I want it to be easy and pretty to show on the web
    So that I get around to actually displaying it.

  I want to be able to convert my postcard into a 3D format (eg. USDZ)
    So that I can preserve the physicality of the postcard.

  I want to be able to extract metadata in easy to process formats (eg. JSON, YAML)
    So that I can create static sites that show off the metadata as well as the front/back.
